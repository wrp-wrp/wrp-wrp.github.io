## rprp (wrp-wrp)

Hi, I'm an undergraduate student in the **Turing Class** (CS Honors Program) at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**.

My primary research interests lie in **Database Systems**, with a specific focus on **Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)**, streaming algorithms, and high-dimensional vector indexing. I am currently a Research Assistant in the Database Group at HUST, working under Prof. Shuhao Zhang.

### 🔭 Research & Engineering
- **Vector Search**: Investigating ANNS in streaming scenarios. I've identified key issues with recall degradation due to distribution shifts and am working on graph-based optimization algorithms.
- **System Building**: I enjoy building high-performance systems using **C++** (6+ years of experience).
- **Publications**: Contributed to a benchmark paper on streaming vector search (under review at SIGMOD).

### 🏆 Competitive Programming
I have a strong background in algorithms and competitive programming:
- **Captain** of the HUST ACM Team.
- **Gold Medalist** in ICPC Regional Contests (Xi'an 2023, Chengdu 2025) and CCF CCSP (2025).
- **Lecturer** at Luogu, teaching advanced algorithms to high school Olympiad contestants.
- **Problem Setter** for ICPC Wuhan Invitational and Hubei Provincial contests.

### 💬 Connect
- **Personal**: I'm an amateur 5-dan Go player.
